# MyChurch-Web-Budget
MyChurch is a web application that helps churches track expeneses. In this final project I stored usernames, passwords, and Budgets in local storage.

This was a final project for a college class and focused on createing classes and storing items in local storage. I created it in a week and learned alot about classes in typescript, troubleshooting, interacting with the HTML page and using localstorage to store the information.
